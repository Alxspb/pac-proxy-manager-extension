‚öôÔ∏è Permissions Explained:

Why Choose PAC Proxy Manager?
Unlike other proxy extensions that are closed-source black boxes, we're completely transparent. Every line of code is available on GitHub. Our minimal permission model means we don't know what websites you access - PAC scripts execute in a controlled, encapsulated environment managed by Chrome itself.

Other proxy managers often require broad permissions like "read all websites" or "modify all data." We only ask for exactly what we need and nothing more.

üÜì Always Free:
This extension will always remain free and open source. No premium features, no subscriptions, no hidden costs. However, if you find it useful and want to support development, coffee donations are greatly appreciated!
